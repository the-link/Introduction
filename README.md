### Hello there. The name is McAllister 👋

About Me :shipit:

    👀 I am somewhat of a self-taught developer in the making. 
    💻 I am an Industrial Systems Integrator.
    🎓 I have an advanced diploma in Industrial Automation, and a Red Seal in Instrumentation
    🌱 I am currently learning Rust, SQL, and maybe later I will try out Ada. 
    💞️ Interests: Reading, disucssing ideas, and thinking about what drives human behaviour.
    ⚡ Current skills include PLC, HMI, and SCADA development
    
 ### 🔭 I am currently working on:
 #### 1. A freight calculation program to make my daily work a little easier. So I am spending hours building something to shave off a few minutes off a task I perform a few times a week :trollface:
 
 #### 2. A program that can be used to track the allocation and utilization of organization resources.
